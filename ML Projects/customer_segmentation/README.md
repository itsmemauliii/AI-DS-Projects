# Customer Segmentation Project

This project uses K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and clustering
- `results/`: Output files including visualizations and segmented data

## Requirements

Install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## How to Run

1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb


2. Or run the scripts:
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
python scripts/clustering.py


## Results

The analysis will:
1. Identify optimal number of customer segments
2. Create a visualization of the customer segments
3. Save the segmented data to a CSV file
How to Use This Project
Create the project structure and files as shown above

Install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset and place it in the data/ folder

Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python scripts

Check the results/ folder for outputs

This project covers all essential data science steps: data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization. You can easily extend it by adding more features or trying different clustering algorithms.
